Exploratory Data Analysis of Missed appointments in Brazil dataset

This dataset presents us with information on over 110,000 medical appointments in Brazil. Brazil has a big problem with missed appointments, with around 1 in 5 people failing to show up.

We are provided with an array of factors such as ID numbers, patient Age, Gender, ScheduledDay (day appointment was scheduled), AppointmentDay, Neighbourhood (where the appointment was to take place), We then have binary columns for factors such as whether the patient is on scholarship, whether they suffer from Alcoholism, Diabetes, or Hypertention, or whether they have any Handicaps. Finally, there is data on whether or not the patient received a reminder SMS, and whether or not they missed their appointment.

Some of the questions I explored with this data set are:

Does age play a factor in predicting whether the patient will show up?
Are men or women more likely to not show?
Does location matter?
Do the SMS reminders actually work?
